## How to run the project

In order to run the application, make sure you are in the `packages/app` directory and run these commands :

- `flutter pub get .`
  
- On Android 🤖: `flutter run -t lib/entrypoints/android/main_google_play.dart`

- On iOS 🍎: `flutter run -t lib/entrypoints/ios/main_ios.dart`



## Alert!

We are currently using Flutter 3.0.5 as the new 3.3.0 has some bugs

Running `flutter downgrade 3.0.5` downgrades the version.
